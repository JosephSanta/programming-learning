#While
#The while loop is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression (condition) is true.
#We generally use this loop when we don't know the number of times to iterate beforehand.

#i= 0
#while i <=3:
#    print("meow")
#    i =i +1

#For
#The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects.
#Iterating over a sequence is called traversal.

#LIST

#for i in range(3):
#    print("meow")

#print give a extra line at the end of the output

#print("meow\n" * 3 , end="" ) #end="" removes the extra line at the end of the output
