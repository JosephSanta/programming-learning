# it can store a value
# it can be used in place of a value

##Comments
#Comments are lines that exist in computer programs that are ignored by compilers and interpreters.

#Pseudocode 
#Pseudocode is a compact and informal high-level description of a computer programming algorithm that uses the structural conventions of programming languages, but omits detailed subroutines or language-specific syntax. It is meant for human reading rather than machine reading.


#coma is used to concatenate strings
#if i use coma, i dont need to use space in the string


#Str
#str is a type of variable that can store a sequence of characters
#str is short for string
#str is always enclosed in quotes
#str can be concatenated using the + operator
#str can be concatenated using the , operator


#Arguments vs Parameters
#Arguments are the actual values that are passed in when the function is called
#Parameters are the variables that are used in the function definition to represent those arguments that were sent to the function


#end='\n'
#end is a parameter of the print function
#end is used to specify what should be printed at the end of the line
#by default, end is set to '\n' which means a new line

#sep=' '
#sep is a parameter of the print function
#sep is used to specify what should be printed between the values
#by default, sep is set to ' ' which means a space

#f string
#f string is a way to format strings in python
#f string is used to insert variables into strings
#f string is used to concatenate strings with variables
#f string is used to concatenate strings with expressions
#f string is used to concatenate strings with functions
#f string is used to concatenate strings with methods
#f string is used to concatenate strings with other strings
#f string can make code more readable
#f string can make math operations easier



#string methods
#string methods are functions that belong to strings
#string methods are called using the dot operator
#string methods are used to manipulate strings


#.strip()
#remove whitespace from str
#remove leading whitespace
#remove trailing whitespace


#.capatalize()
#capitalize the first letter (it can be a space ) of a str

#.title()
#capitalize the first letter of each
#word in a str

#.split()
#split a str into a list of substrings
#split a str at a specified separator
#split a str a specified number of times


#Ask user for their name
#I can combine the input function with the strip method to remove leading and trailing whitespace

#Code by Joseph Santamaria
#name = input("what's your name? ").strip().capitalize().capitalize()

#first , last = name.split(" ")

#say hello to user
#print(f"hello {first} {last}")

#round(numer[, ndigits])
#round is a built-in function in python
#round is used to round a number to a specified number of decimal places
#round is used to round a number to the nearest integer
#round is used to round a number to the nearest multiple of 10 -1000
#ndigits is an optional parameter that specifies the number of decimal places to round to
#numer is the number to round
#[, ndigits] means that ndigits is an optional parameter





# + is used to add two numbers
# - is used to subtract two numbers
# * is used to multiply two numbers
# / is used to divide two numbers
# % is used to get the remainder of a division
# ** is used to raise a number to a power
# // is used to get the integer division of two numbers

#Interactive mode 
#Interactive mode is a command line shell that allows direct interaction with the python interpreter
